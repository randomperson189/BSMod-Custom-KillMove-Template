# BSMod-Custom-KillMove-Template
This is a template addon for creating custom KillMoves for the GMod BSMod addon

I recommend Blender 2.79b for editing the models and animations: https://www.blender.org/download/releases/2-79/  
Make sure to also download Blender source tools: http://steamreview.org/BlenderSourceTools/download.php?v=2.10.2

For compiling the models I recommend using Crowbar: https://steamcommunity.com/groups/CrowbarTool

For compiling your addon and uploading to workshop I recommend reading these:
